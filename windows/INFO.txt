Auto-Stop Media - Windows Service
==================================

This folder contains the Auto-Stop Media Windows background service.

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
This service enables the Firefox Auto-Stop Media extension to control and monitor desktop media applications (Spotify, VLC, Windows Media Player, etc.).

The service runs in the background and connects to the browser extension via WebSocket, allowing you to:
- Control desktop media from your browser
- Automatically pause desktop apps when browser media plays
- See desktop media in the extension popup

LOG FILES

Log files are named by date: service-YYYY-MM-DD.log
- Logs are rotated daily (new file each day)

MANAGING THE SERVICE
--------------------
The service runs automatically at Windows login via Task Scheduler.

To manage the service:
- View logs: Run logs.ps1 from the windows folder
- Restart: Run restart.ps1 from the windows folder

2. Check logs in the logs/ folder
3. Restart the service (restart.ps1)
